# SenseHAT
SenseHAT Pong written in Python

Use the SenseHAT joystick to move the paddle. Try to keep the ball from going past the paddle.

The game gets harder as it continues, including 4 levels:
  
    Level 1: Standard, slow-ish ball, that gets faster as it continues.
    
    Level 2: 2 balls
    
    Level 3: 3 balls
    
    level 4: 1 very fast ball, meant to finish the job.
